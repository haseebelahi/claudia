[High Level Idea]
I want to build a personal asssistant which will help me manage my knowledge which I have learned over the years and I am learning either during my job, as a hobby, through social media (x, linkedin), web browsing and any other reading that I do. I want to build my personal operating system around my knowledge. 

The use cases I have in mind for it is to use it to
- get suggestions for posting on LinkedIn
- get suggestions for writing blogs
- get suggestion tech talks that I could give that are unique to my experience.

[About Me]
- I am a software engineer with more than 8 years of experience. I have worked full stack across different technologies over the years and have learnt a lot of things.
- I am interested in science, personal finance, investing etc. as well and I read about it also.
- I tinker with tech outside of work as well, building personal projects similar to this one also.

[Sources of data]
These are the sources of data I am thinking of which my assistant would access and build my knowledge base from
- my browsing and search history from google
- tweets I bookmark
- Code I write on Github
- Any other which could be helpful
